# Module 3: Python Programming Fundamentals

## Overview
Module 3 provides a comprehensive foundation in Python programming fundamentals, essential for data science. It covers core concepts from basic data types to more advanced topics like functions and error handling.

## Key Concepts

### Conditions and Branching
- Using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Implementing logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Building `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
- Creating nested conditional structures

### Loops
- Implementing `for` loops for iteration through sequences
- Using `while` loops for condition-based iteration
- Using `range()` function for numeric iterations
- Loop control with `break` and `continue` statements

### Functions
- Defining functions with `def` keyword
- Creating reusable code blocks
- Setting parameters and default arguments
- Understanding return values
- Using built-in functions
- Creating user-defined functions
- Managing variable scope (local vs. global)

### Objects and Classes
- Understanding Python's object-oriented nature
- Creating classes with the `class` keyword
- Defining class attributes and methods
- Implementing constructors with `__init__`
- Creating object instances
- Understanding inheritance and polymorphism

### Exception Handling
- Using `try`, `except`, `finally` blocks
- Catching specific exceptions
- Raising custom exceptions
- Implementing error handling best practices

### File Handling Basics
- Opening and closing files
- Reading from files
- Writing to files
- Working with different file formats

## Practical Applications
- Building modular, reusable code
- Implementing decision-making logic in data processing
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Creating custom data processing tools
- Handling errors gracefully in data operations

## Importance for Data Science
Strong programming fundamentals are essential for data scientists to build efficient, maintainable code for data analysis, model building, and automated workflows. These skills form the foundation upon which more advanced data science techniques are built.
