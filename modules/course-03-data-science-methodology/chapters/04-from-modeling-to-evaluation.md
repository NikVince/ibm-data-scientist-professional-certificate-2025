# Course 3, Lesson Summary: From Modeling to Evaluation

This lesson focused on modeling to answer the business question and evaluating whether the model meets that goal.

## Modeling
- Goal: build a model that answers the original business question
- Use a training dataset; test multiple algorithms and variable sets
- Outcomes can be descriptive or predictive depending on the question

## Evaluation
- Two phases: diagnostic measures and statistical significance
- Assess whether the model answers the original question or needs adjustment
- ROC curve helps select optimal binary classifiers by assessing trade-offs

## Takeaways
- Modeling is guided by business goals; evaluation validates usefulness and reliability
- Use appropriate diagnostics and significance tests before deployment
