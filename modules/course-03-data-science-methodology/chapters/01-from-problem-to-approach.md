# Course 3, Module 1 Lesson 1: From Problem to Approach

This lesson introduced a cyclical, iterative methodology for data science and emphasized aligning analytics with the business problem.

## Methodology overview
- John Rollinsâ€™ 10-stage iterative methodology: starts with Business Understanding, ends with Feedback
- Iteration is expected; stages inform and refine each other

## Business Understanding
- Clarify the core business question and success criteria
- Determine the data needed to answer the question

## Analytic Approach
- Select approach based on the question: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive
- Consider ML methods such as clustering and association when appropriate
- Example: decision tree classification as an accessible predictive method for non-specialists

## Takeaways
- Anchor the project in business understanding; choose analytics to match the question
- Expect iteration and incorporate feedback loops by design
