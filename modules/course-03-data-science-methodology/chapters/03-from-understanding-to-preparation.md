# Course 3, Module 2 Lesson 1: From Understanding to Preparation

This lesson connected data profiling to preparation and feature engineering for modeling.

## Data Understanding
- Construct the dataset and assess whether it represents the problem
- Use descriptive and/or predictive statistics as appropriate
- Apply statistics per variable: mean, median, min, max, std dev, pairwise correlation, histograms
- Assess data quality using univariates and distributions

## Data Preparation
- Address missing/invalid values, remove duplicates, validate formats
- Feature engineering: use domain knowledge to create useful features
- Text analysis: verify correct groupings and uncover hidden signals

## Takeaways
- Profiling informs preparation; strong foundations enable robust modeling
- Feature engineering and quality checks are critical to model performance
