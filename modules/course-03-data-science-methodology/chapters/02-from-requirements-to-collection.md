# Course 3, Module 1 Lesson 2: From Requirements to Collection

This lesson covered translating analytic approach into concrete data needs and collecting data to meet those needs.

## Data Requirements
- Identify required content, formats, and sources aligned to the analytic approach
- Revisit and refine requirements as understanding improves

## Data Collection
- Gather data with attention to quantity and quality
- Use descriptive statistics and visualization to assess content and quality, find gaps, and decide if new or substitute data is needed

## Takeaways
- Good collection starts with clear requirements; validation finds gaps early
- Data profiling is essential before proceeding to deeper analysis
