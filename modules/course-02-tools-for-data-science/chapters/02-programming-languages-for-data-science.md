# Course 2, Module 2: Programming Languages for Data Science

This chapter compared common languages and how to select them based on problem and audience.

## Language selection principles
- Match the language to the task, ecosystem, and stakeholders
- Consider performance, libraries, community, and deployment targets

## Popular languages and notes
- Python: scientific stack (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), NLP with NLTK; open source
- R: array-oriented syntax; great for statistics and learners new to programming; free software
- SQL: non-procedural query language for relational databases; broadly portable across vendors
- Scala: Spark ecosystem (MLlib, GraphX, Streaming)
- Java: Weka, Java-ML, Apache MLlib, Deeplearning4j
- JavaScript: TensorFlow.js, R-js for browser-based ML and interactivity
- Julia: JuliaDB; high-performance numerics
- C++: performance-sensitive components and bindings in data systems

## Guidance
- Start with Python and SQL for most data roles; add R for statistics-heavy work
- Use Scala/Java when working deep in the Spark/enterprise JVM stack
- Leverage JavaScript for web-first interactive prototypes and dashboards
