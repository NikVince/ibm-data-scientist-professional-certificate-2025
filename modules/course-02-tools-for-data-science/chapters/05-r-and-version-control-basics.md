# Course 2, Module 5: R Essentials and Version Control Basics

This chapter introduced R for data science alongside foundational version control concepts with Git and hosted platforms.

## R for data science
- Capabilities and common uses in statistics and analysis
- RStudio interface for writing and running R code
- Popular packages: data manipulation, modeling, and visualization
- Visualization approaches: base plot and ggplot2
- Titles and axes: `ggtitle()` and `labs()` for better presentation

## Version control fundamentals
- DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) tracks code changes everywhere
- Enables collaboration across mirrors, issue tracking, and change history
- Repositories (repos) store code, track issues/changes, and support collaboration
- Popular systems: Git (DVCS); hosted platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- Branching isolates changes; merge to integrate into `main`
- Clone repos to work locally and sync changes back upstream

## Takeaways
- R + RStudio offer a powerful workflow for statistical analysis and visualization
- Version control is essential for collaboration, reproducibility, and safe iteration
