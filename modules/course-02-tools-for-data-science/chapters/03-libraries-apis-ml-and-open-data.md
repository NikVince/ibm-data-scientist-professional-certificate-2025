# Course 2, Module 3: Libraries, APIs, ML, and Open Data

This chapter surveyed the core Python libraries for analysis, how APIs enable integration, ML paradigms, and open assets for data and models.

## Python libraries
- Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- ML: Scikit-learn (high-level), with support for regression, classification, clustering

## APIs and REST
- APIs connect software components; REST uses HTTP to access resources
- Key terms: client, resource, endpoint
- Use cases: storage access, model serving, workflow orchestration

## Machine learning overview
- Supervised: regression and classification for prediction and recognition
- Unsupervised: clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Reinforcement learning: sequential decision-making
- Deep learning: neural networks for complex pattern learning

## Open data and model assets
- CDLA: licensing for sharing and using open datasets
- IBM DAX: curated open datasets
- Model Asset eXchange (MAX): pre-trained deep learning models ready to deploy

## Takeaways
- Leverage mature Python libraries for productivity
- Use REST APIs to integrate data and models into products
- Accelerate delivery with open datasets and pre-trained models where appropriate
