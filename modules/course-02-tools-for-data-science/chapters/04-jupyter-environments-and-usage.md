# Course 2, Module 4: Jupyter Environments and Usage

This chapter focused on using Jupyter tools effectively for data scienceâ€”from launching environments to structuring notebooks and managing sessions.

## Jupyter fundamentals
- Notebooks record experiments and projects with interleaved Markdown and code cells
- JupyterLab supports many file types and languages; multiple notebooks can run concurrently
- Two-process model: server (saving/loading notebooks) and kernel (executes code)
- nbconvert enables exporting to formats like HTML, PDF, and slides

## Core operations
- Run, insert, delete cells; present narratives with Markdown + code
- Manage sessions and shut down kernels after work is completed

## Install and environments
- Multiple installation options: Anaconda Navigator, standalone installs, cloud offerings
- Jupyter environments in Anaconda: JupyterLab and VS Code
- Additional open-source environments: JupyterLab, JupyterLite (browser-based), VS Code, Google Colab
- Note: separate installs outside Navigator may require extra configuration

## Takeaways
- Choose the right environment (local vs. cloud vs. browser-only) for your workflow
- Be deliberate about session management and reproducible presentation of results
