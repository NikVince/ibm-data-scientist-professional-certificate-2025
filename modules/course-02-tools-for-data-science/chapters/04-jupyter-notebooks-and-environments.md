# Course 2, Module 4: Jupyter Notebooks and Environments

This chapter explored Jupyter technologies for interactive computing, different environments, and best practices for data science work.

## Jupyter Notebooks fundamentals
- Interactive documents combining code, output, visualizations, and narrative text
- Used for documenting experiments and data science projects
- Cell-based structure with code and markdown capabilities

## Jupyter architecture and components
- Two-process model: kernel (executes code) and client (UI)
- Notebook server manages saving/loading notebooks
- NB convert tool converts notebooks to other formats

## Working with notebooks
- Running, deleting, and inserting code cells
- Operating multiple notebooks simultaneously
- Creating presentations using markdown and code cells
- Importance of shutting down notebook sessions after use

## Jupyter environments
- Anaconda Navigator: GUI for launching multiple applications
- JupyterLab: web-based interactive development environment
- JupyterLite: browser-based tool requiring no installation
- VS Code: integrated development environment with Jupyter support
- Google Colaboratory: cloud-based notebook environment

## Takeaways
- Jupyter provides a flexible, language-agnostic platform for data work
- Multiple installation and usage options fit different workflows
- Best practices include organized documentation and resource management
