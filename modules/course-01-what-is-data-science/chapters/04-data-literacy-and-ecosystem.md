# Course 1, Chapter 4 (Optional): Data Literacy and the Data Ecosystem

This optional chapter strengthened my understanding of how data is generated, stored, and accessed across modern systems, which is essential context for responsible, scalable analysis.

## Data types and characteristics
- Structured (tables), semi-structured (JSON, XML), and unstructured (text, images, audio)
- Trade-offs in schema rigidity, flexibility, and query-ability

## Metadata and discoverability
- What metadata is and why it matters for governance, lineage, and reuse
- Catalogs and documentation for making data findable and trustworthy

## Where to find data
- Internal systems (OLTP databases, data warehouses, data lakes, event streams)
- External sources (open data portals, APIs, purchased datasets)

## Storage tools and capabilities
- Warehouses vs. data lakes vs. lakehouses
- Batch vs. streaming ingestion; partitioning and lifecycle policies
- Access patterns: SQL engines, object storage, query acceleration

## Learning objectives covered
- Compared structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Described the purpose of metadata.
- Identified where to look for data.
- Summarized capabilities of modern data storage tools and technologies.
