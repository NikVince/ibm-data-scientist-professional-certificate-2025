# Course 1, Chapter 1: Foundations of Data Science

In this chapter, I explored how experienced professionals define data science and the non-linear paths many of them took into the field. I learned about the breadth of roles a data scientist can play—from problem framing and hypothesis development to data preparation, modeling, and communicating insights—and how these roles connect within a repeatable process to answer business questions.

## What I learned
- Data science is the disciplined practice of using data to create value through insights, predictions, and data-informed decisions.
- Data science work typically follows an iterative lifecycle: define the problem, acquire and understand data, prepare features, model and evaluate, and communicate outcomes.
- Data analysis is a core part of the lifecycle, informing both problem framing and model evaluation.
- Career pathways into data science are diverse (engineering, business, statistics, analytics), but all benefit from curiosity, resilience, and a willingness to learn continuously.

## Daily activities of a data scientist
- Partner with stakeholders to clarify objectives and constraints.
- Explore data for quality, distributions, and bias; define metrics of success.
- Build baselines before iterating on more complex models.
- Translate findings into decisions, actions, and A/B tests.

## Key terminology clarified
- Dataset, feature, label/target, training vs. test set
- Bias/variance, overfitting/underfitting
- Metric vs. KPI; correlation vs. causation

## Early-career advice I’ll apply
- Focus on understanding the problem before choosing tools.
- Communicate simply: state assumptions, uncertainty, and trade-offs.
- Build a portfolio that emphasizes impact, not just algorithms.

## Why this work matters
Data science is in demand because it operationalizes learning from data at scale and compounds value over time through experimentation, automation, and better decisions.

## Learning objectives covered
- Defined data science and its importance in a data-driven world.
- Listed multiple career paths into data science.
- Summarized seasoned professionals’ advice for newcomers.
- Explained why data science is a top in-demand job today.
- Described a typical day in the life of a data scientist.
- Defined commonly used data science terms.
- Identified key qualities of successful data scientists.
