# Course 1, Chapter 3: Applications and Careers in Data Science

I explored how organizations translate data science into outcomes—from operational dashboards to life-saving healthcare applications—and how the end-to-end process (framing to storytelling) supports those outcomes. I also examined what employers seek and how to position myself in the job market.

## Business impact and use cases
- Product: personalization, recommendation, experimentation
- Operations: forecasting, routing, anomaly detection
- Healthcare: risk stratification, early detection, population health

## Process and deliverables
- Clarify problem, stakeholders, and constraints
- Reproducible analysis and model evaluation with clear metrics
- Final report: narrative, visuals, methods, assumptions, limitations, and next steps
- Storytelling: tailoring insights to decision-makers

## Hiring signals and positioning
- Evidence of impact (metrics, decisions influenced)
- Clear problem framing and trade-off reasoning
- Collaboration, communication, and version control hygiene
- Portfolio aligning with job postings’ skills and tools

## Learning objectives covered
- Interpreted data science job postings and hiring expectations.
- Described data science applications in healthcare and business contexts (Netflix, Amazon, UPS, Google, Apple).
- Explained how companies can begin their data science journey.
- Mapped consumer data generation to business value.
- Differentiated data scientist qualities from other data roles.
- Articulated the purpose and structure of the final deliverable and the role of storytelling.
- Demonstrated understanding of what data scientists do and what a report contains.
