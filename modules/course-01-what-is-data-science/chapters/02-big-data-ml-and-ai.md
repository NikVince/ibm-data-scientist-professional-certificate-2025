# Course 1, Chapter 2: Big Data, Machine Learning, and AI

This chapter deepened my understanding of the big data ecosystem and how cloud and distributed systems enable analytics at scale. I also connected core ML concepts to real-world use cases and clarified how deep learning relates to both ML and broader AI.

## Big Data fundamentals
- The four V’s (extended to five): volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value.
- How Hadoop/Spark and distributed computing make massive-scale processing feasible.
- Cloud characteristics that matter: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service.

## Data mining process
- Goal definition and problem scoping
- Data selection, preprocessing, transformation, feature creation
- Storage considerations (data lakes, warehouses, object stores)

## ML, DL, and AI relationships
- Machine learning: algorithms that learn patterns from data (supervised/unsupervised).
- Deep learning: multilayer neural networks for representation learning at scale.
- AI: broader goal of building systems that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence.

## Algorithms and examples
- Regression for trend analysis and forecasting.
- Classification for risk scoring and routing.
- Clustering for segmentation and anomaly detection.

## Generative AI
- Data-driven models (e.g., LLMs) that generate text, images, and code.
- Uses: synthetic data augmentation, retrieval-augmented generation, task automation.

## Learning objectives covered
- Defined Big Data and distinguishing characteristics.
- Described Hadoop and distributed tools’ role in digital transformation.
- Listed skills relevant to analyzing big data.
- Described five essential cloud computing characteristics.
- Explained the purpose and steps of data mining.
- Differentiated deep learning and machine learning.
- Described regression’s use in prediction and trend analysis.
- Described generative AI and where it fits.
