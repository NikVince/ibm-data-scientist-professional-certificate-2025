# Course 8, Chapter 4: Creating Dashboards with Plotly and Dash

## Overview
This chapter covers building interactive, web-based dashboards using Dash. You learned the roles of Dash Core and HTML components, how callbacks connect inputs to outputs, and how to structure a simple reactive app.

## Components
- Dash Core Components provide higher-level interactive UI elements.
- Dash HTML Components expose a component for every HTML tag.
- Together they allow rapid composition of layouts and controls.

## Callbacks
- A callback is a Python function invoked when an input component property changes.
- Decorate with `@app.callback` to define Inputs and Outputs and update UI reactively.

## Takeaways
- Combine Core and HTML components to build interactive dashboards quickly.
- Define clear Inputs/Outputs in callbacks to respond to user interactions.
- Keep layout and callbacks organized for maintainability.
