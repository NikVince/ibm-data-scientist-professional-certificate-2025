# Course 8, Chapter 2: Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools

## Overview
This chapter covered foundational plots (pie, box, scatter) and how to use Matplotlib/Pyplot to create and customize them, alongside the role of visualization in data storytelling.

## Core Plots
- Pie chart: circular chart divided into slices to show proportions.
- Box plot: summarizes distributions via min, Q1, median, Q3, and max.
- Scatter plot: displays paired values to reveal relationships/trends.

## Using Matplotlib/Pyplot
- Import Matplotlib (typically `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`).
- Pyplot provides a quick, flexible interface for creating and customizing plots.
- Create pie, box, and scatter plots with appropriate `plt`/Axes methods.

## Data Storytelling
- Data storytelling weaves a narrative around data to convey insights.
- Visualization is central to storytellingâ€”choose visuals that match the message and audience.

## Takeaways
- Use pie charts for part-to-whole, box plots for distribution summaries, and scatter plots for relationships.
- Matplotlib + Pyplot offer versatile, fast plotting for many chart types.
- Clear, purposeful visuals are key to compelling data stories.
