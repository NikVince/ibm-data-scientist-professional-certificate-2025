# Course 6, Chapter 5: Summary and Highlights

## Overview
This chapter wrapped up hands-on work with real-world datasets and reinforced practical database exploration skills.

## Key Learnings
- Worked with real-world datasets end-to-end: loading, cleaning, querying, and analyzing.
- Obtained table and column details from databases to understand schema and design effective queries.
  - Inspected catalogs/PRAGMA/INFORMATION_SCHEMA to list tables and describe columns (names, types, constraints).
  - Used this metadata to guide joins, filters, and aggregations.

## Why it matters
- Real data is messy; practicing with authentic datasets builds resilient workflows.
- Knowing how to introspect schema accelerates query design and reduces errors.
